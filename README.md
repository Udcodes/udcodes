### Hi there! 👋🏽 👩🏽‍💻
My name is Udochi and I am a female Frontend Engineer currently working on [Find-A-Recruiter](https://find-a-recruiter.com/) - a web application that provides a portal for Employers to connect with Recruiting Professionals to help meet their needs with finding the right talents in a simple way.

- She/Her are the pronouns to use.   
- I enjoy building for the web🕸 and my favorite javascript framework to use is React 🥰 
- Some tools I work with are sass, style-components, react hooks, context API, redux, graphQL - apollo, rest API, gatsbyJS; and I am always open to getting familiar with new tools. 
- I am currently learning React Hook Form & React Query.
- Here are some fun facts nobody asked for 😊 - my friends (& their friends) consult me for product recommendation for skin-related issues and I am a Manchester United football club fan girl.
- Want to say hi or work with me? You can reach me via direct message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/udochiop), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/udochi-oparaocha-16a01388/) or email - blessingudochi@gmail.com 📧

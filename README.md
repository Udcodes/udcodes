### Hi there! 👋🏽 👩🏽‍💻
My name is Udochi and I am a female Frontend Engineer currently working on [Find-A-Recruiter](https://find-a-recruiter.com/) - a web application that provides a portal for Employers to connect with Recruiting Professionals to help meet their needs with finding the right talents in a simple way.
<br />

- She/Her are the pronouns to use.   
- I enjoy building for the web🕸 and my favorite javascript framework to use is React 🥰 
- Some tools I work with are sass, style-components, react hooks, context API, redux, graphQL, rest API, gatsbyJS; and I am always open to getting familiar with new tools. 
- Here are some fun facts nobody asked for 😊 - my friends (& their friends) consult me for product recommendation for skin-related issues and I am a Manchester United football club fan girl.
<br />

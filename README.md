### Hi there! 👋🏽 👩🏽‍💻
My name is Udochi and I am a female Frontend Developer currently working on [RecruitZen](https://app.recruitzen.com/signin) - a web application that provides a portal for Employers to connect with Recruiting Professionals to help meet their needs with finding the right talents in a simple way. And [Peerless](https://app.peerlesslms.com/) - an enterprise learning management solution that helps organisations and institutions achieve talent development goals, manage knowledge assets, and train business stakeholders with boundless learning.

- She/Her are the pronouns to use.   
- I enjoy building for the web🕸 and my favorite javascript framework to use is React 🥰 
- Some tools I work with are sass, style-components, react hooks, context API, redux, graphQL - apollo, rest API, gatsbyJS; and I am always open to getting familiar with new tools. 
- I am currently learning React Hook Form & React Query.
